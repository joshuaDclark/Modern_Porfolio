            Carolina. I enjoy building modern websites and apps for people
            wanting to get their brand on the web. A few of my interests include
            reading, electric vehicles, science fiction, and camping.

            in backend technologies such as Python, Django, and PostgreSQL, I

            providers such as Wordpress, Wix, and Squarespace. If you are having
            domain service trouble, leave it to me, I can help with that too.
